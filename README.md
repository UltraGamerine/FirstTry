And it is going to be super **Intuitive!**

### Learning Sanskrit Has Never Been This Easy!
Take easy steps. Learn about Noun Cases, and the Verb paradigm consisting of Moods, Aspects, and Tenses.

### Noun Cases
Nouns are easy to decline into different cases, but only if you can easily identify a Noun from a Verb :)

Ever wondered what were those "Prepositions" your school teacher always tried to teach you ?

in Sanskrit the अ (a) ending Words/Nouns go like such -
```
  Cases      English  Hindi  Sanskrit
Nominative     -        -      अः
Accusative     to       को     अम्
Instrumental   with     से      एन
Dative         for    के लिए    आय
Ablative       from     से      आत्
Genetive       of       का     अस्य
Locative       in/on   मे/पर     ए
Vocative       -        -       -
```

`राम + आय = रामाय`

एतत्    <span style="color:green">रामाय</span>  अस्ति

यह   <span style="color:green">राम के लिए</span>  है

This is <span style="color:green">for Rāma</span>.
